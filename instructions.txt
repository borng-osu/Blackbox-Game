BlackBox is a board game created in the 1970s. It can be played by
one or two players.
 
The objective of the game is to find atoms hidden within an 8x8 grid.
The guessing player shoots rays from border spaces. Each ray follows
the path of the arrow which marks border space it enters from.
If its path crosses an atom, it will hit it and not exit the board.
If the ray's path is not obstructed, it will exit the board from the
opposite border space. If the ray encounters an atom to its diagonal,
it will be deflected at a 90 degree angle in the direction opposite
the atom. For example, if an atom is located to the ray's left diagonal,
the ray will deflect to the right, away from the atom. If there is an
atom at each diagonal, the ray will be deflected 180 degrees and
reverse course.

Each entrance and exit is marked after being shot in alphabetical order
starting with 'A'. Based on the entrances and exits of each ray, the
guessing player can then guess the coordinates of each atom (up to 5
allowed on the board).
 
The guessing player starts with a score of 25. For each border space
a ray enters/exits, 1 point is deducted from the score. For each
incorrect guess, 5 points are deducted. The game is won when the
guessing player has guessed all of the atoms on the board. The game
is lost when the guessing player's score drops to or below 0.
